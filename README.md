### Energy Demand Forecast for ERCOT Coast Zone

#### Problem
The purpose of this project is to predict electrical load demand in the ERCOT Coast weather zone. The electrical load demand is regressed on key weather variables such as temperature, humidity, and cloud cover.

#### Jupyter Notebooks and scripts
* Stage 1 includes code for initial exploratory data analysis.
* Stage 2 includes code for regression and forecasting: i.e., model optimization, testing, and performance results.

#### Datasets
The datasets used in this study were acquired directly from the ERCOT website and the Open-Meteo weather data API.

The datasets may be found here:

#### Business Case
An accurate and reliable energy demand forecast helps utilities operate efficiently and manage energy supply to all customers connected to the grid..
